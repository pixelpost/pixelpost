##  Changelog from Pixelpost 1.5 to Pixelpost 1.6

### The Big Changes

*   Tag support

### Feeds

*   Now Pixelpost produces valid ATOM 1.0 feed. Up to Version 1.5, Pixelpost produced valid ATOM 0.3 feed 
*   As the feedvalidator at www.feedvalidator.org issues deprecation warnings whenever it encounters Atom 0.3 feeds, this upgrade was really necessary 
*   RSS: <guid> now produces complete URL + index.php...  
    Example where nn stands for the image-number: <guid>http://www.yourdomainhere.de/index.php?showimage=nn</guid> 



### Security

*   Comments enabled/disabled/moderated for individual posts 
*   More security thanks to switching off error_reporting by default when not logged in 
*   Check if the commenter IP address is in the DSBL list @ <http://www.dsbl.org>. If it is, the user is redirected to a warning page mentioning the used address is blocked. Otherwise, comment gets trough 
*   Users can set the number of seconds between comments in the admin user panel. If a comment is posted before that the script dies because of a possible spam flood 



### Comments

*   Fixed comment redirection when $\_SERVER['HTTP\_referrer'] is empty 
*   Added new functionality: direct redirection after posting comment (without "thank you screen"); it needs <input type='hidden' name='withthankyou' value='no' /> in comment form (in template file) 



### Language and Tags

*   Fixed a bug that the selected language for the blog was shown twice in the list

*   TAG replacement and stuff is added in an addon 
*   If no language is set the 'old' way is used to display the page 
*   Support for [<LANGUAGE=XX>][1] tags (creates url) and [<ALTERNATIVE_LANGUAGE>][2] tag (for switching between the secondary language) 
*   Added secondary language support for title and description 



### Usability
